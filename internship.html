<h2 id="about-company">About Company</h2>
<p>KSPG is the automotive sector of the parent group Rheinmetall. The company emerged in 1997 through the merging of KS Kolbenschmidt, headquarters at Neckarsulm and Pierburg, headquarters at Neuss. Rheinmetall Automotive ranks among the 100 biggest auto industry suppliers worldwide with its major contribution towards the automotive sector being products like exhaust gas recirculation systems (EGRs), secondary-air systems, coolant pumps, and pistons for car gasoline engines and as well as for the commercial vehicle sector.</p>

<h2 id="departments">Departments</h2>
<p>During my internships I was associated with 'Business Excellence', 'Advanced Quality', 'Industrial Engineering' and partially with the 'Pierburg Variable Oil Pump Design Engineering' departments.</p>
<p>The Business and Production Excellence Department mainly focuses on tackling any problem faced during production. The department conducts structured analysis using various mechanical and statistical tools in order to suggest the necessary actions for improvement.
The department of Advanced Quality is responsible for maintaining a Quality ratio of at least 90% during the launch phase. Industrial Engineering Department ensures that the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of production line remains above 80% and all the technical customer specifications for products are met.</p>

<h3 id="projects-overview">Projects Overview</h3>
<h3 id="new-project-1">•	HYUNDAI EXHAUST GAS RECIRCULATION LEAKAGE TEST FAILURE</h3>
<p>Identified the root cause for failure of Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve leakage test. Implemented statistical analysis and fluid systems knowledge to improve accuracy of leakage test bench. Successful in reducing R&R (Repeatability and Reproducibility) values from 173.94% and 96.72% to 15.01% and 1.30% respectively.</p>
<h3 id="new-project-2">•	DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DOE)</h3>
<p>Calculated and set optimum upper and lower limits of the dynamic critical process parameters based on corresponding static process parameters for the assembly stations of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.’s Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) product.
<h3 id="new-project-3">•	VALUE STREAM MAPPING (VSM) ON ASSEMBLY LINES</h3>
<p>Conducted Value Stream Mapping workshop on assembly lines for Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve (EGR). Identified all the Non-Productive Activities over the entire production chain (from supplier to customer) and suggested necessary steps for improvement. Plotted Future State Map to ensure the suggested improvements be properly implemented and sustainable over a course of time.
